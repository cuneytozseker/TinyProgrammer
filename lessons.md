# Developer Journal
- The canvas size is 480x320.
- Do not use `pygame`, `turtle`, or `tkinter`.
- Canvas initialization `c = Canvas()` takes no arguments.
- Only use methods: clear, fill_rect, fill_circle, sleep.
- Do not define functions, write code linearly.
- To remember a technical lesson for next time, focus on syntax errors. Always initialize variables before loops and use parentheses when necessary.
- One technical lesson to remember for next time is to focus on understanding and using Python's libraries effectively.
- Remember to focus on syntax and libraries.
- Focus on coding standards, libraries, and logical flow.

- Remember to check for syntax errors and correct library calls.
- To remember a fundamental error in Python, think about what's wrong with the syntax or library you're using.
- Focus on syntax, libraries, or logic errors.
- Remember to avoid using `c.move()` as it doesn't exist. Always initialize variables before loops and consider initializing empty lists or dictionaries when necessary. Always check for syntax errors in your code.
